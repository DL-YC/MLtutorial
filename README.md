# MLtutorial

This is a set of notes & algorithm implementations of the material covered in Andrew Ng's introduction course to Machine Learning on Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/

Everything is written in iPython notebooks, so that English, math, and code can all live together nicely.  (The math is in MathJax, algorithm implementations in Python.)

It is hoped that the combination of notes and Python implementations will be helpful to those studying the course.

Happy hacking!
